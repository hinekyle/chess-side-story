  Traveling along a dirt path between two fire lookout towers is a chore that Jeremy hurries through.  Thinking of all the different foods being made and songs being sung made him wish he no longer had to help the fire warden care for the town.  Imagining oneself as a bird who could fly free of the town and explore the world and the oceans is what he currently dreams of when a rider dashes across his path.  Thinking only an emergency could send a rider dashing so quickly Jeremy quickly wanders after the rider.  When he arrives most of the town has gathered including his father who reminds him of his duties as the fire wardens apprentice.  

//---- Doesn't feel like a strong enough reason to leave town
  
  This seemed like an emergency!  Isn't helping someone in trouble more important than staring out a tall tower trying to stay awake?  Crowding closely the townspeople cannot wait to hear what happened.  Tom, Jeremy's best friend fell off a horse and hasn't woken up yet, is there a Healer?

//---- What about a kidnapping/ransom?

//---- Gather the crew
  
  Dover was the next town over, but without anyway to get there Jeremy was stuck on firewatch duty.  I'll help!  Take me with you, I have already eaten and can tend to horses.

//---- Give away the first chess piece?  Which one?  Thinking Castles (maybe the fire towers move from town to town?)

//---- Rook? Maybe birds nest in the towers (rookery?)
