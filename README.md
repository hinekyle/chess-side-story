# chess-side-story
Short stories anyone can add to, or use as long as you send me a copy!

My inspiration came when watching my Daughter play with chess pieces, the horses were the coolest, then the Queen and the Castles were next in the line of awesomeness.

The story is set in a universe in which the majority of characters resemble some kind of chess piece.  
> This might sound limiting, but I think it could be very interesting.

Another goal is to slowly reveal the piecies or to give hints about what ties that character to a certain piece.
> I hope to not be rigid with the pieces.  A bishop character needing to be a member of the church or a knight to be associated with horses and armor

The storyline is still up in the air, the chess character universe was the idea.
> The murder mystery was the first storyline idea, next was the adventure
> Another potential storyline could be the chess pieces as children and how they grow into their roles (coming of age)
